======

Description:

This app builds out an API where data is stored in the file system. This API stores notes data.

API:

The URL endpoint to access the api is /api/notes. Using REST the data is read, written and deleted using GET, POST and DELETE requests.

POST

The Post method. Make a POST request with:

echo '{"title":"World of Warcraft", "content":"Note Test"}' | http post http://localhost:3000/api/notes

GET

The GET method. Make a GET request with:

http get http://localhost:3000/api/notes

This will respond with 200 if the request was made, 404 if not found or 400 if the request was made in wrong format.

DELETE
The Delete method. You can see that we first make a request to post to

http delete http://localhost:3000/api/notes?id=(id)

This will respond with 200 if the request was made, 404 if not found or 400 if the request was made incorrectly.

## Submission Instructions
  * fork this repository & create a new branch for your work
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-susan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

## Learning Objectives  
* students will learn to use promise constructs to manage asynchronous code
* students will learn to create a vanilla RESTful API with in-memory persistence

## Requirements
#### Configuration
  * `.gitignore`
  * `.eslintrc`
  * `package.json`
  * `README.md`

#### Feature Tasks
* create the following directories to organize your code:
  * `lib`
  * `model`
  * `test`
* create an HTTP server using the native NodeJS `http` module
* create an object constructor that creates a _simple resource_ with at least 3 properties
  * include an `id` property that is set to a unique id (**hint:** you'll need to use `node-uuid`)
  * include two additional properties of your choice (ex: name, content, etc.)
* create a custom body parser module that uses promises to parse the JSON body of `POST` and `PUT` requests
* create a custom url parser module that returns a promise and uses the NodeJS `url` and `querystring` modules to parse the request url
* create a router constructor that handles requests to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
* create a storage module that will store resources by their schema type (ex: note) and id

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/simple-resource-name`
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
* `GET` request
 * pass `?id=<uuid>` as a query string parameter to retrieve a specific resource (as JSON)
* `DELETE` request
 * pass `?id=<uuid>` in the query string to **DELETE** a specific resource
 * this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body

## Tests
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure the `/api/simple-resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET`: test 404, it should respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `GET`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
 * `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id
 * `POST`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
 * `POST`: test 200, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body

## Bonus
* **2pts:** a `GET` request to `/api/simple-resource-name` with no **?id=** should return an array of all of the ids for that resource
